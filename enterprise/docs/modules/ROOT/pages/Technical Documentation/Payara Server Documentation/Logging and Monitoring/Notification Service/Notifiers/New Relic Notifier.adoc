[[newrelic-notifier]]
= New Relic Notifier

https://newrelic.com/[New Relic] is an application performance monitoring (APM) tool that can be used to gather statistics and notify on key critical events generated by different type of applications. New Relic specializes on integrating Java application servers like GlassFish, JBoss WildFly, etc. and other application frameworks seamlessly.

Payara Server includes a special notifier to send notifications from the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Logging and Monitoring/Notification Service/Overview.adoc[Notification service] to the New Relic **Insights service** using its remote API. Custom notification events generated from Payara Server's own monitoring systems like the Request Tracing and Healthcheck services can be automatically identified by this API and gathered correctly to identify performance issues on the application server.

[[newrelic-integration-configuration]]
== New Relic Configuration

In order for the notifier to work correctly, you must complete the following requirements:

. Create a New Relic user account. You can sign up for a new account https://newrelic.com/signup[here]
+
NOTE: New Relic offers 14-days trial accounts that can be used to test the service for free.

. Configure application performance monitoring (APM) for a Payara Server instance by installing a New Relic Java agent
. Configure a New Relic Insights API key that will be used to set up the notifier.

=== Configure Application Performance Monitoring for Payara Server

The first task is to set up the New Relic Java agent in Payara Server. To do that, follow these steps:

. Login to New Relic with your account credentials, and if you haven't set up a monitoring agent yet, the following screen will be shown:
+
image:notification-service/newrelic/agent-setup-1.png[New Relic agent setup welcome screen]

. Select the *Java* option and the agent installation procedure will be shown:
+
image:notification-service/newrelic/agent-setup-2.png[New Relic Java agent setup procedure]
+
From the screen shown, copy the value of the _License Key_ (you need to press the *Reveal License Key* button first) since you will need it later.

. Now, on the same screen press the *Download the Java Agent*. This will download the Java agent files to your station. Unzip the files and copy the resulting folder to the root folder of the Payara Server domain you want to monitor. In the following example we are copying it to the default domain `domain1`:
+
[source, shell]
----
unzip newrelic-java-3.XX.X.zip
mv newrelic ${PAYARA_INSTALL_DIR}/glassfish/domains/domain1
----

. Before proceeding to install the agent into the Payara Server domain, we need to configure the License Key we got earlier. To do this, modify the agent's configuration file that's located at `${PAYARA_DOMAIN_DIR}/newrelic/newrelic.yml` by using the `license_key` property:
+
[source, yaml]
----
  # ...
  # This section is for settings common to all environments.
  # Do not add anything above this next line.
  common: &default_settings

    # ============================== LICENSE KEY ===============================
    # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic
    # account. ...
    license_key: '073f5089681d0e96d5e0a9691251a626ea90286d'

    # Agent Enabled
    # Use this setting to disable the agent instead of removing it from the startup command.
    # Default is true.
    agent_enabled: true

    # Set the name of your application as you'd like it to show up in New Relic.
    # ...
    app_name: Payara Server 4.1.2.172

    # ...
----
+
NOTE: We also recommend setting the name of the application under the `app_name` property to correctly identify this server's domain on the APM dashboard

IMPORTANT: The License Key value must be inserted using single quotes (')

. Now, proceed to install the agent by running the following command at the root of the domain folder:
+
[source, shell]
----
java -jar newrelic/newrelic.jar install
----
+
If the installation was successful, the output of the agent's installer will show it like this:
+
[source, shell]
----
***** ( ( o))  New Relic Java Agent Installer
***** Installing version 3.39.1 ...

* Backed up start script to /opt/payara-4.1.2.172/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/domain.xml.20170613_180108
* Added agent switch to start script /opt/payara-4.1.2.172/glassfish/domains/domain1/config/domain.xml

* No need to create New Relic configuration file because:
 A config file already exists: /opt/payara-4.1.2.172/glassfish/domains/domain1/newrelic/newrelic.yml

***** Install successful

***** Next steps:
You\'re almost done! To see performance data for your app:

1) Restart your app server
2) Exercise your app
3) Log into http://rpm.newrelic.com

Within two minutes, your app should show up, ready to monitor and troubleshoot.
If app data doesn\'t appear, check newrelic/logs/newrelic_agent.log for errors.
----
+
The installer will modify the domain.xml configuration file of your server's domain
and add the configuration of the Java agent as a JVM start argument:
+
[source, xml]
----
<java-config classpath-suffix="" debug-options="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=9009" system-classpath="">
  <jvm-options>-javaagent:${com.sun.aas.instanceRoot}/newrelic/newrelic.jar</jvm-options>
  <jvm-options>-server</jvm-options>
  ...
</java-config>
----
+
NOTE: The agent setup page has a different set of instructions for Windows and Linux environments, but they are so similar that the instructions mentioned here should be sufficient.
+

TIP: If you are considering installing the New Relic Java agent on a Payara Server standalone instance or a cluster of multiple instances, you need to manually add the JVM (the installer won't work) option with the `javaagent` configuration to the instance/cluster referenced configuration. Also, make sure that the directory where the _newrelic.jar_ resides also contains the `newrelic.yml` configuration file

. Now that the agent has been installed, start the Payara Server domain. You will observe the following messages at the start of the domain's log
+
[source, log]
----
INFO: New Relic Agent: Loading configuration file "/opt/payara-4.1.2.172/glassfish/domains/domain1/newrelic/newrelic.yml"
INFO: New Relic Agent: Writing to log file: /opt/payara-4.1.2.172/glassfish/domains/domain1/newrelic/logs/newrelic_agent.log
...
----

. After some minutes with the server working, you can login back to the New Relic portal and on the *APM* dashboard you can see a new entry for recently configured server:
+
image:notification-service/newrelic/apm-dashboard.png[New Relic APM Dashboard]
+
You can also access the latest monitoring statistics:

[[retrieving-api-key]]
=== Retrieving the API Key from New Relic Insights

Now that the agent has been correctly installed, login back to your New Relic account portal and head to the *Insights* dashboard:

image:notification-service/newrelic/insights-dashboard.png[New Relic Insights Dashboard]

Access the _Manage Data_ option on the side menu, you will be presented the following screen:

image:notification-service/newrelic/insights-api-keys-screen.png[New Relic Insights API Keys]

Click on the `+` icon at the side of the *Insert Keys* header. Take note of the
_Account ID_ and _API Key_ value on this screen. Also add a brief description to
reference this key on the dashboard:

image:notification-service/newrelic/insights-insert-api-key.png[New Relic Insights Insert API Keys]

[[payara-server-configuration]]
== Payara Server Configuration

With the New Relic Java agent and Insights API Key correctly configured, you can proceed to configure the New Relic notifier on the Payara Server domain. As usual you can do this using the administration web console, from the command line or editing the _domain.xml_ configuration file directly.

[[using-the-administration-web-console]]
=== Using the Administration Web Console

To configure the Notification Service in the Administration Console, go to _Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like server-config)] -> Notification Service_ and click on the *New Relic* tab:

image:notification-service/newrelic/new-relic-admin-console-configuration.png[New Relic Configuration on Admin Console]

Check the *Enabled* box (and the *Dynamic* box too if you don't want to restart the domain) and input the New Relic Account ID and the newly inserted
Insights API Key. Hit the *Save* button to preserve the changes.

[[from-the-command-line]]
=== From the Command Line

To configure the Notification Service from the command line, use the `set-newrelic-notifier-configuration` asadmin command, specifying the tokens like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-newrelic-notifier-configuration --dynamic=true --enabled=true --accountId=1658989 --key=b5815wdxj6lF_tmMBljQa5y1603JTiLh
----

You can use the `--enabled` and `--dynamic` options to enable or disable the New Relic notifier on demand.

Also, you can retrieve the current configuration for the New Relic notifier using the `get-newrelic-notifier-configuration` asadmin command like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin > get-newrelic-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Filter   Key                               Account Id
true     WARNING  b5815wdxj6lF_tmMBljQa5y1603JTiLh  1658989
----

[[on-the-domain.xml-configuration-file]]
=== In the _domain.xml_ configuration file

To configure the Notification Service in the _domain.xml_ configuration file, locate the `notification-service-configuration` element in the tree and insert the `newrelic-notifier-configuration` with the respective attributes like this:

[source, xml]
----
<notification-service-configuration enabled="true">
    <new-relic-notifier-configuration account-id="1658989" key="b5815wdxj6lF_tmMBljQa5y1603JTiLh" enabled="true"></new-relic-notifier-configuration>
</notification-service-configuration>
----

WARNING: Modifying the domain.xml configuration is not a supported configuration method, so be careful when considering this option.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

When you have correctly configured the New Relic notifier, it can be used observe notification events on the New Relic Insights service dashboard .
If you do not see any notification event messages on the data explorer, check the following:

* Is the New Relic notifier enabled?
* Is the Notification Service itself enabled?
* Is there a service configured to use the notifier? (e.g. the HealthCheck service)
* Is the service configured to send notifications frequently enough to observe?
* Have you enabled the service after configuring it?
* Is the *Java Agent* for your Payara Server's domain correctly configured?
* Have you created a valid API Key for the Insights service?
* Does your account ID and the Insights API key match the ones configured on the Payara Server notifier?

Here's a sample of how these notifications are visualized on the Data Explorer dashboard for the New Relic Insights service:

image:notification-service/newrelic/insights-data-explorer-results.png[New Relic Insights Data Explorer]

You can observe that the events are correctly identified depending on the severity of the notification and they are correctly grouped by their custom category (in the image only the *Healthcheck* events are shown).
