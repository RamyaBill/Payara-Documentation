[[notification-service]]
= Notification Service

Payara Server comes with a general Notification service that can be used to log events which come from other services, such as the xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Logging and Monitoring/Monitoring Service/JMX Monitoring.adoc[JMX Monitoring Service], the xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Logging and Monitoring/HealthCheck Service.adoc[HealthCheck service] or the xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Logging and Monitoring/Request Tracing Service/Overview.adoc[Request Tracing service].

[[notifiers]]
== Notifiers

The Notification service provides the ability to disseminate notification events through various channels or **notifiers**, which relay them to different destinations.

[[filtering]]
=== Filtering

All notifiers make use of a filtering system to accept or ignore notification events. Events are emitted with a severity level of `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `SEVERE`. Notifiers may be individually configured to filter out events which are below a certain severity level.

NOTE: A notifier with a filter level of `WARNING` (the default) will disregard events at the `INFO` level, and accept event at the `WARNING` and `SEVERE` levels.

The following is a list of the default set of notifiers available in Payara Server.

[[log-notifier]]
=== Log Notifier

The log notifier is the only notifier that is enabled by default when the notification service is activated.

The default output for the log notifier is the configured instance's log file, which is either the _server.log_ file or _cluster.log_ file, depending on the instance configuration. The log notifier only handles the output of notifications from the notification service sent to the log and is not responsible for any other log output.

[[log-configuration]]
==== Configuration

Because the log notifier is the default notifier for the notification service it can be configured on the same page as the notification service, as shown in the image below:

image:notification-service/log/log-admin-console-configuration.png[Log Notifier Configuration]

For any new domain, the notification service will be disabled by default. It can be enabled through the admin console as shown above, or via the Asadmin CLI.

To configure the log notifier through the Asadmin CLI, use the `set-log-notifier-configuration` subcommand:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-log-notifier-configuration --enabled=true --dynamic=true
----

To get the current configuration of the log notifier, use the `get-log-notifier-configuration` subcommand:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> get-log-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Filter   Use Separate Log File
true     WARNING  false
Command get-log-notifier-configuration executed successfully.
----

[[jms-notifier]]
=== JMS Notifier

The JMS notifier makes use of a JMS queue to send notification events from services such as the Request Tracing and HealthCheck services. These messages can then be consumed by a Message Driven Bean or any other JMS compatible client implementation.

[[jms-requirements]]
==== Requirements

To use JMS as a notification target, you will need the following a JMS-compatible message broker.

IMPORTANT: The Payara Server Web Profile distribution does not come with JMS capabilities, so this notifier isn't supported.

NOTE: The easiest way to configure the JMS notifier is to use the embedded OpenMQ broker, since Payara Server already comes with it by default.

[[jms-configuration]]
==== JMS Notifier Configuration

The notifier configuration requires following a few steps:

. Create a new *JMS Queue* to receive the notification messages from the notifier:
+
image:notification-service/jms/prepare-jms-destination.png[Create JMS Queue]
+
To make this change via the Asadmin CLI, use the following subcommand which mirrors the above screenshot:
+
[source, shell]
----
asadmin create-jms-resource --enabled=true --property=Name=notifierQueue --restype=javax.jms.queue jms/notifierQueue
----

. Set the JMS Notifier settings:
+
image:notification-service/jms/jms-admin-console-configuration.png[Configure JMS Notifier in Admin Console]
+
The above example uses the embedded OpenMQ broker's default configuration.
+
To make this change via the Asadmin CLI, use the following command which mirrors the above screenshot:
+
[source, shell]
----
asadmin set-jms-notifier-configuration --dynamic=true --enabled=true --contextFactoryClass=com.sun.enterprise.naming.SerialInitContextFactory --target=server-config --queueName=notifierQueue --url=localhost:7676 --connectionFactoryName=jms/_defaultConnectionFactory
----

[[verify-the-configuration]]
==== Verifying the Configuration

For verification purposes, it may be useful to enable a service to push notifications through the JMS notifier to demonstrate that it is working. To do this, you will also need to setup a Message-Driven Bean (MDB) to consume the notifications and demonstrate that they are being stored in the queue.

. First, enable a service to push data through the notifier. For example, the HealthCheck service's CPU metric can be configured to push CPU metrics to a notifier every _5 seconds_:
+
[source, shell]
----
asadmin> healthcheck-configure --enabled=true --dynamic=true --enableNotifiers=jms-notifier
asadmin> healthcheck-configure-service --serviceName=healthcheck-cpu --enabled=true --dynamic=true --time=5 --unit=SECONDS
----
+
This also configures the HealthCheck service to send notifications to the JMS notifier, which will cause the messages to be sent right away.

. To consume the messages using a **JMS 2.0** compliant MDB, the following class will work for a pre-configured queue named `notifierQueue`:
+
[source, java]
----
@MessageDriven(activationConfig = {
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationLookup", propertyValue = "jms/notifierQueue"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationType", propertyValue = "javax.jms.Queue"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destination", propertyValue = "notifierQueue"),
})
public class NotificationConsumer implements MessageListener {

    @Override
    public void onMessage(Message message) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Message received: " + message.getBody(String.class));
        }
        catch (JMSException ex) {}
    }
}
----

. View the result of the MessageDrivenBean's `onMessage()` command. In this example, the CPU metric of the health check service was configured to notify every _5 seconds_, so the result of simply printing to `System.out` is following log entries:
+
[source, log]

==== Asadmin Commands

[[set-the-jms-notifier-configuration]]
===== Set the JMS notifier configuration

To set the JMS notifier configuration, the following asadmin command will reflect the configuration done in the previous section:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-jms-notifier-configuration --dynamic=true --enabled=true
  --contextFactoryClass=com.sun.enterprise.naming.SerialInitContextFactory
  --connectionFactoryName=jms/__defaultConnectionFactory
  --queueName=notifierQueue
  --url=localhost:7676
  --username=****
  --password=****
  --target=server-config
----

[[get-the-jms-notifier-configuration]]
===== Get the JMS notifier configuration

To get the JMS notifier configuration using the Asadmin CLI, run the following command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> get-jms-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Filter   Context Factory Class  Connection Factory Name  Queue Name  URL  Username  Password
true     WARNING  com.sun.enterprise.naming.SerialInitContextFactory  jms/__defaultConnectionFactory  notifierQueue  localhost:7676  myusername  mypassword
Command get-jms-notifier-configuration executed successfully.
----

It will return the details of the current JMS notifier configuration, like in the following example:

[[event-bus-notifier]]
=== Event Bus Notifier

The Event Bus Notifier provides a way to send notifications from the notification service into the internal Payara Server event bus, which is based on Hazelcast distributed topics.

IMPORTANT: Notifications sent to the internal event bus using this notifier are intended to be received by internal server components and not by user applications. Currently, no built-in internal components consume event bus notifications yet and there are no available APIs that allow applications to consume these events.

NOTE: The Data Grid (and Hazelcast by extension) must be enabled for the Event Bus to be available.

[[event-bus-notifier-configuration]]
==== Event Bus Notifier Configuration

This notifier provides only one configuration option, the **Topic Name**, which is mandatory.

In the Admin Console, simply set the **Topic Name** to a desired name, which will be used to setup the Hazelcast topic that will receive the notifications.

image:notification-service/event-bus/event-bus-admin-console-configuration.png[Event Bus Configuration]

Make sure that the "Enabled" box is ticked so that the notifier will be used. If you would like the changes to take effect without needing a restart, tick the "Dynamic" box as well.

To make these changes via the Asadmin CLI, use the following subcommand:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-eventbus-notifier-configuration --topicName=my-topic --dynamic=true --enabled=true
----

To check the current applied configuration from asadmin, run the command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> get-eventbus-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Filter   Topic Name
false    WARNING  payara.notification.event

Command get-eventbus-notifier-configuration executed successfully.
----

[[cdi-event-bus-notifier]]
=== CDI Event Bus Notifier

The CDI Event Bus notifier provides a way to send notifications from the notification service into the internal Payara Server's CDI Event bus. These notifications consist of CDI asynchronous events that can be consumed by user applications with valid CDI beans set up as listeners.

[[notifier-configuration-2]]
==== CDI Event Bus Notifier Configuration

You can configure the CDI Event Bus notifier from the Admin Console like this:

image:notification-service/cdi-event-bus/cdi-event-bus-admin-console-configuration.png[CDI Event Bus Configuration]

The following options are available:

`Enabled`:: Enables/disables the notifier.
`Dynamic`:: Applies changes to the notifier without a server restart.
`Loop Back`:: Whether events should also be observed on the same instance that triggered the instance or not.

To make these changes via the Asadmin CLI, use the following subcommand:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-cdieventbus-notifier-configuration --loopBack=true --dynamic=true --enabled=true --hazelcastEnabled=true
----

To check the current applied configuration from asadmin, run the command:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> get-cdieventbus-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Filter   Loopback
false    WARNING  false
Command get-cdieventbus-notifier-configuration executed successfully.
----

[[observing-events]]
==== Observing Notification Events

Any application deployed to any instance in the Data Grid can observe notification events triggered by the CDI Event bus notifier.

Event  messages are instances of the `EventbusMessage` class, which provides structured data about the specific event type, such as `HealthCheckNotificationData` or `RequestTracingNotificationData`. It also provides the same information in a String form in the `title` and `message` fields. 

Notification events can be observed as a standard `@Inbound` CDI event of type `EventbusMessage` or its super-types:

[source, java]
----
public void observe(@Observes @Inbound EventbusMessage event) {
    String shortInfo = event.getSubject()
    String detailedMessage = event.getMessage();
    
    String domainName = event.getDomain();
    String sourceInstanceName = event.getInstance();

    if (event.getData() instanceof HealthCheckNotificationData) {
        Optional<HealthCheckResultEntry> mostCritical = event.getData()
        .as(HealthCheckNotificationData.class).getEntries()
        .stream().sorted().findFirst();
    }
}   
----

IMPORTANT: For an application to use the `Inbound` annotation and `EventbusMessage` class, it will have to define the xref:/Technical Documentation/Public API/Overview.adoc[Payara Public API] as a dependency.

[[removing-notifiers]]
== `Removing Notifiers`
All Payara notifiers are included in Payara Enterprise by default, however they are fully pluggable and can be removed from your Payara installation. Each notifier consists of 2 parts, a notifier-core and a notifier-console-plugin. The notifier core is responsible for the notifier functionality and the asadmin commands, the notifier-console-plugin is not essential, but allows for the notifier to be configured through the admin console.

To remove a notifier from Payara Enterprise edition, first find the relevant modules to the notifier you want to remove in `${PAYARA_HOME}/glassfish/modules`. To fully remove the notifier, you should delete both the notifier-core and the notifier-console-plugin files, then restart the domain.

If you change your mind in the future, you can just drop both the notifier-core and optionally the notifier-console-plugin files back into the `${PAYARA_HOME}/glassfish/modules` directory and restart the domain.
