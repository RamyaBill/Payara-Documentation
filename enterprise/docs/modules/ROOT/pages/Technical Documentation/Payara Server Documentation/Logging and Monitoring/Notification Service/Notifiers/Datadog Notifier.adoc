= Datadog Notifier

https://www.datadoghq.com[Datadog] is a cloud metric aggregator that simplifies the gathering and visualization of multiple platform stacks and services that can be on premises or on the cloud. Datadog also eases browsing through of all this information by implementing combination graphs (multiple graphs that can be configured on a single view) of related metrics.

Datadog supports gathering metrics from the following sources:

* Cloud Providers (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform)
* Message Queues (Apache Kafka, ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ)
* Code Repositories (GitHub, Bitbucket)
* Clustering and DevOps Tools (Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, Docker)
* Web Servers (Apache HTTP, Nginx, LightHTTP)
* SQL and NoSQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CouchBase)
* Monitoring Solutions (New Relic, Nagios, Splunk, Amazon Cloud Trail)

Payara Server includes a special notifier to send notifications from the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Logging and Monitoring/Notification Service/Overview.adoc[Notification service] to a Datadog account by means of an API key.

IMPORTANT: Currently, the Payara Datadog notifier only supports the `US1 - East` region.

== Datadog Account Integration

When you create a Datadog account, the service will provide you a default API key that you can use to integrate Payara Server with your account.

NOTE: You can sign up for a free trial account (14 days) if you want to test this integration without having to worry about a permanent subscription.

Here are the instructions to retrieve the API keys:

. First, access the Datadog administration panel located at https://app.datadoghq.com/. Then, in the side menu select your name in the bottom left _Organisation Settings_ -> _API Keys_ option:
+

. On the API Keys tab you will observe the default API Key available for integration:
+

+
You can also create a new API key if you want to use it exclusively for your Payara Server installation.

. Assign a name to the default API key or a newly created key, so you can identify which services or platform stacks are integrating with Datadog other than your Payara Server installation:

[[payara-server-configuration]]
== Payara Server Configuration

Having retrieved the API key from Datadog's administration panel, it's necessary to configure this key to the notification service on Payara Server. It's possible to do this either by using the administration web console, from the command line using administration commands or by modifying the _domain.xml_ configuration file directly.

[[using-the-administration-web-console]]
=== Using the Administration Web Console

To configure the Notification Service in the Administration Console, go to _Configuration -> [instance-configuration (like server-config)] -> Notification Service_ and click on the *Datadog* tab:

Check the *Enabled* box (and the *Dynamic* box too if you don't want to restart the domain) and input the three tokens highlighted in the previous section. Hit the *Save* button to preserve the changes.

[[from-the-command-line]]
=== From the Command Line

To configure the Notification Service from the command line, use the `set-datadog-notifier-configuration` asadmin command, specifying the tokens
like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> set-datadog-notifier-configuration --dynamic=true --key=af510f122026bc9107f7c5f4f049e597 --enabled=true
----

You can use the `--enabled` and `--dynamic` options to enable or disable the Datadog notifier on demand.

Also, you can retrieve the current configuration for the Datadog notifier using the `get-datadog-notifier-configuration` asadmin command like this:

[source, shell]
----
asadmin > get-datadog-notifier-configuration

Enabled  Filter   Key
true     WARNING  af510f122026bc9107f7c5f4f049e597
----

[[on-the-domain.xml-configuration-file]]
=== On the _domain.xml_ configuration file

To configure the Notification Service in the _domain.xml_ configuration file, locate the `notification-service-configuration` element in the tree and insert the `datadog-notifier-configuration` with the respective attributes like this:

[source, xml]
----
<notification-service-configuration enabled="true">
  <log-notifier-configuration enabled="true"></log-notifier-configuration>
  <datadog-notifier-configuration enabled="true" key="af510f122026bc9107f7c5f4f049e597"></datadog-notifier-configuration>
</notification-service-configuration>
----

WARNING: Modifying the _domain.xml_ configuration is not a supported configuration method, so be careful when considering this option.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

When you have correctly configured the Datadog notifier, Datadog can gather relevant monitoring events from your Payara Server installation. If you do not see any notification event messages on your Datadog account, check the following:

* Is the Datadog notifier enabled?
* Is the Notification Service itself enabled?
* Is there a service configured to use the notifier? (e.g. the HealthCheck service)
* Is the service configured to send notifications frequently enough to observe?
* Have you enabled the service after configuring it?
* Does the configured API key on Payara Server match one of the API keys configured on your Datadog account?
* Is Datadog running in the US1 region?

Here's a sample of how the notifications are visualized on the Datadog event notification panel (on the side menu select the _ServiceMgmt -> Events_ option):
