[[sample-generated-jakarta-rest]]
== Sample Generated Jakarta REST Resource

Here's an example of a generated Jakarta REST resource using Payara Starter:

[source,java]
----
package fish.payara.hello;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.QueryParam;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

@Path("hello")
public class HelloWorldResource {

    @GET
    public Response hello(@QueryParam("name") String name) {
        if ((name == null) || name.trim().isEmpty()) {
            name = "world";
        }
        return Response.ok(name).build();
    }
}
----

This sample demonstrates a simple REST endpoint named `hello` that accepts a query parameter `name` and responds with a greeting message.

Feel free to adjust archetype parameters to tailor the generated application to your project requirements.

[[new-feature-er-diagram-integration]] 
== ER Diagram Designer with Generative AI Support

Payara Starter https://start.payara.fish[start.payara.fish] enables developers to streamline the creation of full-stack applications by leveraging Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams. Generative AI enhances this process by automating the generation and customization of diagrams based on inputs and requirements. Developers can visualize, interact, and modify these diagrams in real time, making Payara Starter a more powerful tool for application design and development.

image::payara-starter/er-diagram.png[ER Diagram, width=50%]

[[features-of-er-diagram-integration]] 
=== Features of ER Diagram Designer

==== Default ER Diagrams: 
The Payara Starter website includes default ER diagrams, stored in https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html[Mermaid format], which users can modify as a starting point for their own designs.

image::payara-starter/existing-er-diagram.png[Existing ER Diagram, width=50%]

==== Automated ER Diagram Generation: 
Payara Starter automates ER diagram generation by leveraging Generative AI based on user-provided descriptions. Users can create accurate and well-structured diagrams with minimal effort.

==== Real-time Diagram Design via Free-text Support
Through *Real-time Diagram Design via Free-text Support*, users can interact with Generative AI to refine and enlarge existing diagrams based on their specific requirements. This feature allows users to quickly modify or create new diagrams using free-form text commands.

WARNING: Generative AI is a helpful assistant for designing diagrams, but it is not perfect. Not all instructions will be understood as intended, and some results may differ from user expectations.

===== Instructions and Examples

To get the best results, users should provide clear, concise commands. Below are a few sample scenarios to illustrate how users can modify their diagrams:

image::payara-starter/free-text-support-0.png[Default ER Diagram]

1. **Add a Field**: Following command prompts the AI to include a new attribute named `expiryDate` in the existing `PRODUCT` entity.

   Command: Add an Expiry Date field to the `PRODUCT` entity.	

image::payara-starter/free-text-support-1.png[Add a Field]
   
2. **Change Entity Name**: Following instruction directs the AI to change the name of the `PRODUCT` entity, allowing for a new designation that may better reflect its purpose or context within the application.

   Command: Rename the `PRODUCT` entity to other alternate name.

image::payara-starter/free-text-support-2.png[Change Entity Name]
   
3. **Modify Field**: Following command results in the AI updating the names of all fields that begin with `product`, replacing that prefix with `item`, thus standardizing or rebranding the fields for consistency.

   Command: Rename all the fields with `product` prefix to `item`.

image::payara-starter/free-text-support-3.png[Modify Field]
   
4. **Enhance diagram by adding more entities and relationship**: Following instruction instructs the AI to enrich the diagram by introducing new entities (`Company`, `Brand`, `Customer`, `Purchase`) and defining relationships between them, thus expanding the data model to cover more aspects of the application domain.

   Command: Add `Company`, `Brand` details of product and also add `Customer`, `Purchase` info.

image::payara-starter/free-text-support-4.png[Enhance diagram by adding more entities and relationship]

IMPORTANT: Users should review and modify the diagram after the AI-assisted prototype is generated. For more complex designs or detailed customizations, manual changes may be necessary to ensure the final diagram meets all requirements.

The AI is designed to speed up the process of generating diagram prototypes, but the user is responsible for creating the complete and accurate design of the application's source code.

==== Interactive Auto-Pilot Mode: 
An innovative auto-pilot mode allows users to dynamically enlarge or shrink the number of entities in the ER diagram using (+/-) buttons, providing a quick way to modify complexity without detailed configuration.

* **Enlarge (\+):** Adds additional entities or relationships to the diagram based on the current context. For example, clicking the "+" button might introduce a related table, such as an `Order` entity linked to an existing `Customer` entity, along with predefined attributes or relationships.

* **Shrink (-):** Removes entities or relationships from the diagram to simplify its structure. For instance, clicking the "-" button could remove auxiliary entities that are not critical to the application's initial design.

This feature helps users quickly prototype or refine their diagrams by adjusting the scope and complexity of the database structure, without requiring manual edits to every detail.

==== Live Diagram Panel: 
The Payara Starter interface includes a split panel where the https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html[Mermaid] source code appears on the left, and a live visual representation of the ER diagram is shown on the right. Any changes made in the source or through Generative AI interactions update the visualization immediately.
Users can freely modify the ER diagram by editing the Mermaid source code directly in the left panel. These modifications are instantly reflected in the live preview, offering full control over the diagram's structure and appearance.

==== Full-Stack Application Generation: 
Once finalized, Payara Starter uses the ER diagram to automatically generate corresponding JPA entities and REST endpoints, making it easy to move from design to implementation.

[[using-the-er-diagram-feature]]
=== Using the ER Diagram

==== Open the existing or Generate a new ER Diagram:
Open the ER Diagram panel within the Payara Starter application interface.
Select from pre-loaded diagrams or start a new diagram by pressing the **Diagram Builder & Live Preview** button and entering a description.

image::payara-starter/create-er-diagram.png[Create ER Diagram]

==== Enhance the Diagrams:
Use the Real-time Diagram Design via Free-text support to interact with OpenAI. Type specific requests, such as "Add an Order entity" or "Make Customer and Order related," and receive real-time updates to your diagram.
In auto-pilot mode, use the (+/-) buttons to quickly enlarge or shrink the diagram.

image::payara-starter/update-er-diagram.png[Update ER Diagram]


==== Generate Full-Stack Application:
Once the ER diagram meets your requirements, you can initiate the full-stack application generation. Payara Starter uses the diagram structure to create JPA entities, repository services, REST endpoints, and optionally web pages.  

**Optional Features and Dependencies:**  
During the generation process, you can customize the output to include or exclude specific components. Note the cascading dependencies between components:  

* *JPA Entities*:  
  If skipped, all other components (repository services, REST endpoints, and web pages) will also be skipped. Only the ER diagram will be saved to the root of the project.  

* *Repository Services*:  
  If skipped, the generation of REST endpoints and web pages will also be skipped.  

* *REST Endpoints*:  
  If skipped, web pages will also be skipped.  

* *Web Pages*:  
  Can only be generated if repository services and REST endpoints are included.  

This flexibility allows developers to tailor the generated application to meet their specific project needs while ensuring structural coherence.
