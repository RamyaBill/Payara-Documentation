== Generating a New App using Payara Starter

You can generate a new application using Payara Starter in two ways:

[[commandline-archetype]]
=== Command Line Using Archetype:

To generate a new application using the Payara Starter archetype from the command line, use the following Maven command:

[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=fish.payara.starter -DarchetypeArtifactId=payara-starter-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-beta4  <other options>
----

This command generates a new application based on specified options. Adjust these properties according to your project requirements.

=== Payara Starter Website

Visit https://start.payara.fish[start.payara.fish] to use a web application to generate new application projects using a simpler graphical interface.

[[using-the-payara-starter-web-application]]
==== Using the Payara Starter Web Application

Payara Starter provides a convenient web application that allows you to generate Jakarta EE projects via a graphical interface.

Follow these steps to use the web application:

. Access the web application:
* Visit the Payara Starter web application at https://start.payara.fish[https://start.payara.fish].

. Fill in the *Project Details*:
* On the web application's landing page, you'll find a user-friendly interface to input project details.
* Enter the required information, such as *Group ID*, *Artifact ID*, and other relevant details.
+
You can customize these based on your project requirements:
+
image::payara-starter/project-details.png[Project Details, width=50%]

. Choose the *Build System* and *Jakarta EE Version*:
* Select your preferred build system (Maven or Gradle) from the provided options.
* Choose the desired Jakarta EE version that aligns with your project's compatibility requirements.
+
image::payara-starter/jakartaee.png[Jakarta EE version, width=50%]

. Configure any *Additional Options*:
* The web application allows you to configure additional options such as MicroProfile integration, Payara Platform version, and more.
* Customize these options based on your project needs.
+
image::payara-starter/payara-platform.png[Payara Platform, width=50%]

. Review and Generate:
* Review the summary of your selected options to ensure they match your project requirements.
* Click the *Generate* button to initiate the project generation process.

. Download the Generated Project:
* Once the generation process is complete, the web application triggers the download of the generated project archive.
* Download the project archive, and you can then proceed to import it into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

NOTE: The web application simplifies the project creation process but may not expose all configuration options available through the command-line archetype generation. +
If you need better control of how the application is generated, we recommend using the starter archetype instead.

[[sample-generated-jakarta-rest]]
== Sample Generated Jakarta REST Resource

Here's an example of a generated Jakarta REST resource using Payara Starter:

[source,java]
----
package fish.payara.hello;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.QueryParam;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

@Path("hello")
public class HelloWorldResource {

    @GET
    public Response hello(@QueryParam("name") String name) {
        if ((name == null) || name.trim().isEmpty()) {
            name = "world";
        }
        return Response.ok(name).build();
    }
}
----

This sample demonstrates a simple REST endpoint named `hello` that accepts a query parameter `name` and responds with a greeting message.

Feel free to adjust archetype parameters to tailor the generated application to your project requirements.

[[new-feature-er-diagram-integration]] 
== ER Diagram Designer with Generative AI Support

Payara Starter enables developers to streamline the creation of full-stack applications by leveraging Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams. Generative AI enhances this process by automating the generation and customization of diagrams based on inputs and requirements. Developers can visualize, interact, and modify these diagrams in real time, making Payara Starter a more powerful tool for application design and development.

image::payara-starter/er-diagram.png[ER Diagram, width=50%]

[[features-of-er-diagram-integration]] 
=== Features of ER Diagram Designer

==== Pre-loaded Diagrams: 
The Payara Starter includes default ER diagrams, stored in Mermaid format, which users can modify as a starting point for their own designs.

image::payara-starter/existing-er-diagram.png[Existing ER Diagram, width=50%]

==== Automated ER Diagram Generation: 
Payara Starter automates ER diagram generation by leveraging Generative AI based on user-provided descriptions. Users can create accurate and well-structured diagrams with minimal manual configuration.

==== Real-Time Chat Support:
Through an integrated live chat, users can interact with Generative AI to refine and expand existing diagrams based on their specific requirements.

==== Interactive Auto-Pilot Mode: 
An innovative auto-pilot mode allows users to dynamically expand or shrink the number of entities in the ER diagram using (+/-) buttons, providing a quick way to modify complexity without detailed configuration.

==== Live Diagram Panel: 
The Payara Starter interface includes a split panel where the Mermaid source code appears on the left, and a live visual representation of the ER diagram is shown on the right. Any changes made in the source or through Generative AI interactions update the visualization immediately.

==== Full-Stack Application Generation: 
Once finalized, Payara Starter uses the ER diagram to automatically generate corresponding JPA entities and REST endpoints, making it easy to move from design to implementation.

[[using-the-er-diagram-feature]]
=== Using the ER Diagram

==== Open the existing or Generate a new ER Diagram:
Open the ER Diagram panel within the Payara Starter application interface.
Select from pre-loaded diagrams or start a new diagram by pressing the **Diagram Builder & Live Preview** button and entering a description.

image::payara-starter/create-er-diagram.png[Create ER Diagram]

==== Enhance the Diagrams:
Use the live chat support to interact with OpenAI. Type specific requests, such as "Add an Order entity" or "Make Customer and Order related," and receive real-time updates to your diagram.
In auto-pilot mode, use the (+/-) buttons to quickly enlarge or shrink the diagram.

image::payara-starter/update-er-diagram.png[Update ER Diagram]


==== Generate Full-Stack Application:
Once the ER diagram meets your requirements, initiate the full-stack application generation. Payara Starter uses the diagram structure to create corresponding backend entities, repository services and rest endpoints.

The integration of OpenAI with diagram generation in Payara Starter empowers developers to design, adjust, and visualize application architectures effortlessly, fostering rapid iteration and streamlined development. This feature represents a significant leap forward in developer productivity and application design capability.
