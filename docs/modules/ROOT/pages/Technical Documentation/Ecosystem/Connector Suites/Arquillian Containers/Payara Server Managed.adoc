= Payara Server Managed Arquillian Container Adapter

When using this adapter, the Payara Server container lifecycle is managed by Arquillian by starting a separate JVM process to run Payara Server locally.

NOTE: As a requirement, the adapter will need to use a local installation of Payara Server.


[[usage]]
== Usage

The Payara Server Managed Arquillian container adapter can be found on link:https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/fish.payara.arquillian/arquillian-payara-server-managed[Maven Central], and can be included in your project using the following Maven GAV coordinates:

<dependency>
  <groupId>fish.payara.arquillian</groupId>
  <artifactId>arquillian-payara-server-managed</artifactId>
  <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>

[[configuration]]
== Container Configuration

The Payara Server container can be configured via the `arquillian.xml` file using the standard http://arquillian.org/arquillian-core/#container-configuration[Arquillian Container Configuration] mechanism.

The following configuration options are mandatory:

* `payaraHome` - The local Payara Server installation directory. Can be also set using the `payara.home` system property.

The following Arquillian Container configuration options are available:

[cols="20,70,10"]
.Configuration Options
|===
| Name | Description | Default

| `adminHost`
| The host to be used to access the Payara Server Admin interface.
| `localhost`

| `adminHttps`
| You can use it to specify whether the HTTP or HTTPS protocol shall be used to access the DAS. The property value can be `true` or `false`.
| `false`

| `adminPort`
| The port to be used to access the Payara Server Admin interface.
| `4848`

| `adminUser`
| The name of the admin user of your DAS.

If omitted, no authentication will be used to access the DAS.

In this case the `adminPassword` property should also be empty.
|

| `adminPassword`
| The password of the admin user of your DAS.

Cannot be omitted if you declare the admin user.

If no authentication will be used to access the DAS you must have empty password for your admin user of your domain.
|

| `allowConnectingToRunningServer`
| Allow Arquillian to use an already running Payara Server instance and skips `start-domain` command invocation.
| `false`

| `authorisation`
| If true, basic access authentication is enabled.

It also indicates that remote server requires an `adminUser` and `adminPassword` configuration properties.
| `false`

| `debug`
| Starts the server in debug mode using standard Payara Server debug port.
| `false`

| `domain`
| The Payara Server domain to use or the default domain if not specified.
| `domain1`

| `enableH2`
| Starts/Stops the registered H2 database server using the standard H2 port.
| `false`

| `ignoreCertificates`
| If set to `true`, SSL certificate correctness is ignored.

This is useful for Docker images / Testcontainers when certificates are not easily matched to internally generated ones and host names are also very hard to match.
| `false`

| `libraries`
| A comma-separated list of library JAR files. Specify the library JAR files by their relative or absolute paths.

Specify relative paths relative to `domain-dir/lib/applibs`. The libraries are made available to the application in the order specified.
|

| `outputToConsole`
| Show the output of the admin commands on the console.
| `true`

| `payaraHome`
| The local Payara Server installation directory. Mandatory
| Value of the `payara.home` system property.

| `properties`
| Optional keyword-value pair that specify additional properties for the deployment.

The available properties are determined by the implementation of the component that is being deployed.
|

| `target`
a| The deployment target of the applications involved in the test.

Valid values of the target are:

`server`:: Deploys the component to the default Admin Server instance (on your DAS server). This is the default value if the property is omitted.

`instance_name`:: Deploys the component to the specified stand-alone server instance, which may be on the same hosts or can be on a different one as the DAS server.

`deployment_group_name`:: Deploys the component to every server instance in the specified deployment group. They can be on the same or on several other hosts as the DAS server.

NOTE: Arquillian will use only one instance to run the test case.

The domain name as a target is not a reasonable deployment scenario in case of testing.

The HOST address and port numbers of the test server instance used by Arquillian (determined by the target property) will be automatically retrieved from the DAS server.

TIP: You have to make them accessible for your test environment (consider any firewall or proxy configuration).

| `server`

| `type`
| If set to `osgi`, the component is packaged as an OSGi bundle.

If the component is packaged as a regular archive, do not set this option.
|
|===

The context root that will be used to run the tests is also retrieved automatically from the DAS server. If the deployed application does have a `sun-web.xml`, `glassfish-web.xml` or `payara-web.xml` deployment descriptor, the container will use the name of your deployment without the extension as context root. +
The same rule is applied for enterprise applications if there is no `application.xml` file. The JAR test-deployments are treated as a web application.

[[examples]]
== Examples

To configure the Arquillian Container options, you need to use an `arquillian.xml` file placed on the test classpath.

Here's an example `arquillian.xml` file. It configures `adminPort` with a static value.

It will configure the `adminPassword` as a value of a system property `my.admin.password`, which you can specify for example in the maven `surefire` plugin using the `systemPropertyVariables` option or on the command line like `mvn -Dmy.admin.password=mypassword test`.

            <property name="adminPassword">${my.admin.password}</property>
        </configuration>
    </container>
</arquillian>
----

If you want to configure more containers, you can switch between them by setting the `arquillian.launch` system property to the container's qualifier.

This is how you can do it with the maven `surefire` plugin (`my.admin.password` system property is used to set the `adminPassword` property in `arquillian.xml`):

[[automatic-download-example]]
=== Downloading Payara Server automatically from Maven

You can configure your Maven project to automatically download and install the Payara Server version required by the container adapter.

To set up this installation, you can use the link:https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/usage.html[Maven Dependency Plugin] (specifically the `unpack` goal) as follows:
